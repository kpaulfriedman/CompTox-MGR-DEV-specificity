# CompTox-MGR-DEV-specificity
This code accompanies the Browne et al. manuscript, "The elephant in the room: how we evaluate adverse chemical effects." This code uses data from the public database ToxRefDB v2.1 to understand the categories of endpoints observed at the adverse effect level (critical effect level) in multi-generation reproduction and prenatal development studies.

## How this code can be used
The code to generate Figure 1 in the manuscript is included here. The code to generate the Supplemental Data from ToxRefDB v2.1 (including the positive findings for the multi-generation reproduction and developmental toxicity study types) is here also. The .html output of the .Rmd is included for download and browsing without having to run the code.
